# 📘 Student Table Renderer in TypeScript

This project demonstrates how to use TypeScript to define a `Student` interface, create student objects, and render a table dynamically in the browser using plain JavaScript (Vanilla JS).

---

## 📁 Files

- `main.ts` – TypeScript source file that defines the interface, data, and DOM manipulation logic.
- `index.html` – Simple HTML file that loads the compiled JavaScript (`main.js`).

---

## ✨ Features

- Defines a `Student` interface with the following properties:
  - `firstName` (string)
  - `lastName` (string)
  - `age` (number)
  - `location` (string)
  
- Creates two student objects and stores them in an array.

- Dynamically renders an HTML table that lists each student's **first name** and **location** using Vanilla JavaScript.
